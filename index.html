      Tale of Two Cities is a historical novel published in 2017 by Brian Kipkirui, set in Nairobi and Paris before and during the French Revolution.
      The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long
      imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris, and his release to live in Nairobi
      with his daughter Lucie whom he had never met. The story is set against
      the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of
      Terror. As Brian's best-known work of historical fiction, A Tale of Two
      Cities is said to be one of the best-selling novels of all time.
      In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBC's The Big Read poll. The
      novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has
      continued to influence popular culture.
